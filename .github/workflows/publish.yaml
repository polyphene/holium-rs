# Flow that has 2 possible logics depending on the event:
#   - "pull_request":
#     - `cargo workspaces exec cargo publish --dry-run`: Execute a dry run for publication on each crate in the repo, making sure
#     that publication will be possible on merge
#   - "push":
#   - `cargo workspaces exec cargo publish --token ***`: For every crate in our workspace, publish it on crates.io
